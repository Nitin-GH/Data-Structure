Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move all disks from source rod to destination rod using third rod (say auxiliary). The rules are :

1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) A disk can be moved only if it is on the top of a rod.
3) No disk can be placed on the top of a smaller disk.

Print the steps required to move n disks from source rod to destination rod.
Source Rod is named as 'a', auxiliary rod as 'b' and destination rod as 'c'.
Input Format :

Integer n

Output Format :

Steps in different lines (in one line print source and destination rod name separated by space)

Sample Input :

2

Sample Output :

a b
a c
b c
